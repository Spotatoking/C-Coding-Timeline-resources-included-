Today's work:
1. Read and understood most of Ch 16 of the Code book
  Summary: This was a hard chapter. It dealt with the logic of subtracting numbers in binary. This individual chapter has taken me the most time yet of all the chapters so far. It introduced the concept of complements of a number(be it in binary system or decimal system).After this introduction, a smaller component was constructed to implement the idea of complements in binary form. This component was then connected to a slightly modified 8 bit adder previously constructed. This modified adder and the component[now on called the complement] together made up a machine that can add and subtract 8 bit numbers. The caveat being that only one of the two numbers can be -ve at a time, and that this -ve number must not be greater in magnitude than the positive number[this would lead to a error that is collected in the form of an 'overflow' output]. This section was succeeded by an interpretation of binary numbers such that an 8 bit binary code may be used to represent a range of 7 bit -ve and +ve numbers with one exception caused due to the nature of binary numbers. This was accomplished via the use of a 'sign bit'.This was all I was able to understand so far, the last part of the chapter ,I presume, deals with the addition of two 7-bit numbers represented by the previously mentioned system, using an 8-bit adder as a base, with some extra logic gates being used as collectors for the overflow outputs.
