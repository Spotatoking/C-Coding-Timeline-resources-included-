Today's work
Finished the second half of Ch 13 of the Code book
Summary:This chapter was very heavy and hard to digest. It explained the base level workings of the ASCII and Unicode formats of characters . The conversion of the values of Unicode using the UTF-8 format ws the hardest part of the book yet.But this has given a more indepth understanding of the working of the typing we use in our day to day life and how it relates to the lowest level of computing
