Today's work
1. Read and understood Ch 15 of the Code book.
Summary: This chapter first gave a brief history of construction of computers themselves. Then it points out the issues faced by the relays used to make logic gates and the rudimentary adders in earlier chapters. It then goes on to propose some alternatives to the mechanical relays,such as vaccumm tubes and transistors. Ultimately, the most recent development in the field, ICs are discussed and some common TTLs used in the 1970s are discussed. This chapter mainly serves to explain the importance of the hardware factor in computing, and how the issue can be solved by using functionally identical hardware, which is better in some factors when compared to the original hardware due to it's inherent working principles.
