Today's work: 
Read Ch 11 of The Code book. Summary: This was the most eye opening chapter yet. It helped understand the common ways in which the concept of binary number system is used in encoding things used in our daily life. Didn't understand the latter part of the QR code encoding. But still very enlightening.
