Today's work:
1. Read and understood Ch 13 of the Code book.
  Summary: This chapter involved the construction of a machine whose purpose is the addition of two 8 bit numbers. This task was accomplished using just 3 of the six standard logic gates.The concept of most importance conveyed here is where to start when constucting an appplication. First, one must have a solid idea of what one means to accomplish with the application. Then, it must be decided with which tools the  application is to be  built. Only after these two preliminary steps are concluded that one can start to actually construct the application. The construction should ideally start with the input that will betakenfrom the user, then the interface which the user will be using. After this, the internal workings of the application can be worked upon. 
Another important lesson is the encapsulation of bits of code or machinary that will be used constantly in the application. This will help people inspecting the application to understand the internal working of the application.
