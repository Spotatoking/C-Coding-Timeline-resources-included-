Today's work:
1. Read More of CH 17 of the Code book.
Summary: The Chapter continued to explain about flip flops. A new and better working flip flop, the D flip flop was made using a combination of the previously made RS flip flops. This was then combined to make a 8- bit latch which can be used to store a byte of data.So far to this point all the flip flops and related materials were made to work on the Level Triggering principle. The drawbacks of this system was discussed and a new type of triggering, edge triggering flip flop was implemented by series combination of two D type flip flops.
